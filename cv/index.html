<h2>Junior Front End Developer</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a self taught professional freelance junior web developer with a passion for learning new things. <br>

I am confident using HTML and CSS, as well as alongside Bootstrap and WordPress. I understand version control. I am able to balance my time, use my initiative and know when to ask for help advice in order to be an efficient member of a team. I can manage my time effectively having done so for the past 10 years with my animation clients.</br>

I am currently learning React and getting excited by the possibilities of building apps with it.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p class="job-title">Freelance animator/Front end web developer</p>
<p class="date">2017-2017</p>
<p class="place">Pyramid Design</p>
<p>At pyramid, I was originally brought in for an animation contract to create a pitch video for one of their clients. They kept me on for another week on a trial basis as they were looking to fill a web developer position too. During my time there, I updated existing WordPress sites with new images, copy text at the clients request.<br>

I created <a href="www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/Accordial_sitemap.pdf">site maps</a> for a new project and designed the <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/pyramid-portfolio.html">pages</a> in Photoshop.<br>

I coded a <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/getronics/getronics.html">website page</a> from a pre-made photoshop design.<br>

The senior web developer and agency director were impressed with how quickly I picked things up. They were unable to offer me the job as the person who they were hoping to replace came back.</p>
