<h2>Junior Front End Developer</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a self taught professional freelance junior web developer with a passion for learning new things. <br>

I am confident using HTML and CSS, as well as alongside Bootstrap and WordPress. I understand version control. I am able to balance my time, use my initiative and know when to ask for help advice in order to be an efficient member of a team. I can manage my time effectively having done so for the past 10 years with my animation clients.</br>

I am currently learning React and getting excited by the possibilities of building apps with it.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p class="job-title">Freelance animator/Front end web developer</p>
<p class="date">2017-2017</p>
<p class="place">Pyramid Design</p>
<p>At pyramid, I was originally brought in for an animation contract to create a pitch video for one of their clients. They kept me on for another week on a trial basis as they were looking to fill a web developer position too. During my time there, I updated existing WordPress sites with new images, copy text at the clients request.<br>

I created <a href="www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/Accordial_sitemap.pdf">site maps</a> for a new project and designed the <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/pyramid-portfolio.html">pages</a> in Photoshop.<br>

I coded a <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/getronics/getronics.html">website page</a> from a pre-made photoshop design.<br>

The senior web developer and agency director were impressed with how quickly I picked things up. They were unable to offer me the job as the person who they were hoping to replace came back.</p>

<p class="job-title">Work experience</p>
<p class="date">2016-2016</p>
<p class="place">Cognition Agency</p>
<p>Cognition was my introduction to how web agencies operated. They made use of my existing design skills by having me assisting the Senior Creative by making artwork in Photoshop and Illustrator for new and existing sites and social channels (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). I also passed the HubSpot Inbound Certification here which has improved my understanding of designing better user experiences.

<p>For the past 10 years, I have been working on animation for studios/agencies as well as my own clients. Most of my work has been art directing/animating music videos.
