<h2>Junior Software Developer</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a self taught professional junior software developer with a passion for learning new things.<br>

I am confident using HTML, CSS, JavaScript alongside Bootstrap and WordPress. I use version control. I am able to balance my time, use my initiative and know when to ask for help advice in order to be an efficient member of a team. I can manage my time effectively, having done so for the past 10 years with my animation clients.</br>

My current role involves working agile in a team to develop api driven mobile apps. I create and develop projects all the way from conception to deployment, testing and continued support. 
I specialise in front-end and UX, working in React and AWS Serverless.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<div class="job-header">
<p class="job-title">Junior Software Developer</p>
<p class="date">2018-2019</p>
</div>
<p class="place"><a href="https://www.wearesauce.io/" target="_blank">{Sauce}</a></p>
<p>At Sauce, I work with react native and redux, focussing on the front end side of the app. I work in agile, in a small development team of 3, using Jira to track our progress. We have regular meetings with our clients at the end of sprints, in which I lead the agenda or take minutes. I have presented the progress of our app to other developer teams.<br>
I attend events such as Codepen Hull, which is sponsored by Sauce to learn more about current trends within the industry.<br>
I also attend recruitment events to encourage young people, in particular girls, to consider a career in tech.</p>

<p class="job-title">Freelance animator/Front end web developer</p>
<p class="date">2017-2017</p>
</div>
<p class="place"><a href="http://www.pyramid-design.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pyramid Design</a></p>
<p>At pyramid, I was originally brought in for an animation contract to create a pitch video for one of their clients. They kept me on for another week on a trial basis as they were looking to fill a web developer position too. During my time there, I updated existing WordPress sites with new images, copy text at the clients request.<br>

I created <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/Accordial_sitemap.pdf" target="_blank">site maps</a> for a new project and designed the <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/pyramid-portfolio.html" target="_blank">pages</a> in Photoshop.<br>

I coded a <a href="http://www.prolificpolymath.com/pyramid/getronics/getronics.html" target="_blank">website page</a> from a pre-made photoshop design.<br>

The senior web developer and agency director were impressed with how quickly I picked things up. They were unable to offer me the job as the person who they were hoping to replace came back.</p>

<p class="place"><a href="https://www.cognitionagency.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cognition Agency</a></p>
<p>Cognition was my introduction to how web agencies operated. They made use of my existing design skills by having me assisting the Senior Creative by making artwork in Photoshop and Illustrator for new and existing sites and social channels (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). I also passed the HubSpot Inbound Certification here which has improved my understanding of designing better user experiences.
