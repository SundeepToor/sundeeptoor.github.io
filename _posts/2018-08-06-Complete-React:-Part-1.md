<p>I'm now currently working through the <a href="https://completereactcourse.com/">Complete React Course by Andrew Mead</a> on Udemy.</p> 

<p>It's helping reinforce previous lessons learnt from Codeacademy and FreeCodeCamp.</p>

<h3>Some notes I've made so far:</h3>

<p>If you reference an object within a JavaScript expression, it doesn't know what to do with it so you get an error.</p>

<p>'Objects are not valid as a React child' in the console.</p>

<p>To display anything, you need to refer to a property in the object, i.e user.name</p>

<p>.map is better than forEach as we can transform an array into a new one.</p>

<p>it is better to reference functions than to add them directly in JSX to an element inline. Easier to read.</p>

<p>Objects are not supported in arrays in JSX.</p>

<p>You can render an array in JSX into another JSX expression.</p>


<p>Here is the <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/naWdrx/">collection of codepens</a> created while working through this course.</p>
