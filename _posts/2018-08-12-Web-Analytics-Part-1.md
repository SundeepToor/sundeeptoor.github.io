<h2>What are Analytics?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>analysis of data</li>
  <li>i.e. analysing your business and competitions's data to drive continual improvement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recent trends in Digital Analytics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Big data</li>
  <li>Cloud</li>
  <li>Diagnostic analytics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>numbers, words, opinions</li>
  <li>for digital, mainly numbers</li>
  <li>Qualitive data is gathered through user research (observing people to understand why they do certain things)</li>
  <li>Quantitative date through analytics (identifying what actions users take when they come to a page, how many users take those actions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Quantitive data allows us to measure baselines which we use to inform design decisions.</p>

<p>Analytics is for everyone and is everywhere.<br>
An analyst cannot simply measure hits on server, must measure human behavious.</p>
<ul>
  <li>likes on facebook</li>
  <li>likes on tweet</li>
  <li>steps in a day</li>
<br>
  <li>2.4 billion people connect and interact in one minute</li>
  <li>80% of consumers are more likely to recommend a brand that offers a simpler experience</li>
  <li>80% - 90% of companies consider big data analytics top priority</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud computing makes it easy to store/collect data.</p>

<h3>FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANALYTICS:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS<br>
    - What has happened?<br>
    i.e. How many customers bought a chocolate bar last week?</li>

<li>DIAGNOSTIC ANALYTICS<br>
- Why did it happen?<br>
i.e. Why did that many people buy a chocolate bar on this day?</li>

<li>PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS<br>
- What will happen?<br>
i.e. What will happen if I run a buy one get one free campaign on chocolate bars?</li>

<li>PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS<br>
- How can I make something happen?<br>
- How can I double the sales of my chocolate bars?</li>
</ol>

<p>These types of analytics use metrics based around Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).</p>

<p>KPI - measureable action/signal that is correlated to business success.</p>

<p>Retweets on Twitter don't directly  increase how much users like or know and organization.
Ideally, an organization should have multiple KPIs for one business object to increase reliability of data.</p>

<h3>COMMON METHODOLOGIES</h3>
<h4>Research</h4>
<ul>
  <li>prioritize goals/questions in order to focus attention</li>
  <li>once know goal, create hypothesis then test it</li>
  <li>data analysts measure results of research and tests</li>
  <li>researchers and analysts recognize outliers</li>
  <li>come to conclusions, able to predict future outcomes based on patterns they identify</li>
</ul>

<h4>Measurement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>most metrics help us understand how an organization/brand is growing</li>
  <li>measure number of users, speed of sites. time spent on page</li>
  <li>offline details such as amount of money made, number of sign-ups, number of purchases</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only measure without research, nothing to compare to, data is meaningless. Data tracking is ongoing measurement supported with reasearch with an intent of analysis.</p>

<h4>Analysis</h4>
<ul>
  <li>break down infromation into smaller pieces, examine what it means</li>
  <li>gives meaning to measured data</li>
  <li>allows us to make connections</li>
</ul>

<h4>Daily Tasks and Deliverables</h4>
<ul>
  <li>setting key performance indicators</li>
  <li>optimizing content</li>
  <li>setting up analytics tools</li>
  <li>monitor and measure</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tools of the trade</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Google analytics</li>
  <li>Moz Pro</li>
  <li>Clicktale</li>
  <li>KISSmetrics</li>
  <li>Crazy Egg</li>
</ul>

<p>How Analytics are used to supercharge your business</p>
<ol>
  <li>Targeted direct marketing<br>
  - integrate customer data from multiple web/social media interactions<br>
  - determine effectiveness by customer type, location, delivery channel</li>

  <li>Predictive advertisement targeting<br>
  - present ads that consumers want to click</li>

  <li>Fraud detection<br>
  - Need to knwo which transactions/applications for credit, benefits, reimbursements, refunds etc are fraudulent.<br>
  - businesses need to minimize false insurance claims, inaccurate credit applications, false identities</li> 

  <li>Investment risk management<br>
  - 'big data' needs evaluating with predictive analytics in order to know what to invest in</li>

  <li>Customer retention with churn modeling<br>
  - every business wants to know if customer is about to leave and why, so they can do something to sway them to stay<br>
  - learn what incentive one-time customers need to return</li>

  <li>Movie recommendations<br>
  - movies recommended based on past reviews, related interests, analysis of twitter comments etc<br>
  - analysis on movie scripts, based on reaction to films, predict box office revenue</li>

  <li>Education - guided studying for targeted learning<br>
  - guidance on which question areas need more study<br>
  - every student needs help on how to spend their study time more effectively<br>
  - schools need same analysis to provide effective teaching</li>

  <li>Political campaigning with voter persuasion modelling<br>
  - find out what persuades voters  phone call, door knock, flier, tv ad)</li>

  <li>Clinical decision support systems<br>
  - costs escalating, important to determine which patients are at risk of developing certain conditions<br>
  - predictive analytics can help make best medical decisions</li>

  <li>Insurance and mortgage underwriting<br>
  - allow auto insurance companies to accurately determine cover aswell as their bottom line<br>
  - assess borrower's ability to pay back mortgage</li>
</ol>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF MEASURABLE OUTCOMES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>identify business problem, then understand how it can be measured</li>
</ul>

<p>Five objectives useful to measure for business:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Branding</li>
  <li>Online information and support</li>
  <li>Content publishing</li>
  <li>Lead generation</li>
  <li>E-commerce</li>
</ol>

<h3>Measuring metrics for business success</h3>
<h4>The measurement Process</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Create a strategy<br>
  - at least a general idea of what you want to accomplish</li>
  <li>Define Key Peformance Indicators<br>
  - ensures discussion around metric focuses on how to improve whether than debate if it's the right metric</li>
  <li>Implement them<br>
  - implement KPIs prior to launch to get the most data to use</li>

  <li>Measure and Improve<br>
  - Baseline from launch<br>
  - Baseline against historical average<br>
  - Baseline against the same period last year</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conversions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>- key metrics in website analytics for online businesses/blogs</li>
  <li>an activity on your site that is important to the success of your business</li>
  <li>better to know how visitors engage with your site (click link, purchase product)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Measure conversions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>conversion rate (no. of conversions divided by number of visitors)</li>
  <li>higher the conversion rate, higher the engagement with end users</li>
  <li>to increase a low conversion rate, maybe look into changing website layout/placement of products</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of conversion</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Micro conversions<br>
  - activities that precede a purchase on a website/business objective</br>
  i.e. signups for an email newsletter/account creations</li>
  <li>Macro conversions<br>
  - general idea of how website is performing<br>
  i.e. how many sales transactions for a specific product, number of online insurance quotes</li>
</ol>
<p>Macro conversion is number of users following a blog. The macro conversion is purchasing something you talked about on the blog.</p>

<p>The continual improvement process<br>
- consists on gathering data, reporting, analysing, testing, insights</p>

<p>Example with chocolate bars</p>
<ol>
  <li>understand how many choclate bars were sold</li>
  <li>we report on it</li>
  <li>analyse the report ( why sell that many? What were drivers?)</li>
  <li>Testing (offer on bar? change packaging?)</li>
  <li>Analyse results of the testing to get insight (price is key?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Analytics is an iteractive process.</p>
