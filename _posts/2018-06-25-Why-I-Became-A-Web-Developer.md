Why I have become a web developer

An award winning animator. Figured out my own production line that works well for me.

I have always drawn, but I have always made things. Films, sculpture.
Heavily inspired by disney films. Wanted to be an animator and studied animation at university.

After 8 years of animating full time, why change?
It's not enough to just be good at what you do. There must be opportunities. If your skills are not in demand, there is nothing you can really do about that. To me, particular opportunities that suit my style of animation are few and far between.
However, I'm not just a creative person. I'm a maker at heart.

I could have gone into graphic or web design or something more visual but didn't. I felt that if I was going to start over, it should be something that feels new. I'm excited by new things, and it feels like I'm pushing my abilities. I like to look back on the year and see what I have achieved.  Why web development?
you don't need a degree 
Despite what people think, coding is really creating. It involves making something amazing useful seemingly from nothing.
Skills are in demand.
There are more industries relying on coding skills for various things. I'm quite a restless eprson who needs to be challenged and this field of work would keep me on my toes in. a good way.

If I was going to the learn something new, I wanted it to be skills that had longevity. Web development offered that.

Learning html and CSS was quite straight forward. CSS keeps you on your toes and is moving in new directions which excites my creative side.

Flexible nature of the work. You can work from anywhere which is really appealing. This would be something I would do further down my career. Right now I want to surround myself with more talented developers so I can learn things i WOULDN'T NORMALLY PICK UP ON. Y OWN.

There are a lot of resources where you can teach

To improve my understanding further, I'm working through SuperHi's WordPress course. The community behind this course has been beneficial.


After being a generalist in front end web development, the next steps will involve learning JS frameworks and possibly specialise in making engagingly animated components for software
